#client side 
so basically in this project you can use client 1 and client 2 code in node mcu and attach a occupacy sensor to pin D2 of node mcu 
when the use sit into the chair it start transmitting 0 and here we provide static ip to node mcu only you need to change the ip and gateway ip and mask ip accourding  to your router and thats it and upload the code in nodemcu . 


#server side 

now on that side server first go and ask to client status and then accept then request of user and send html data to the user how search his ip address in search engine as well as client status.
